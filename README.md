# Mid-level Harmonic Audio Features for Musical Style Classification

This repository contains the implementation of the musical style classification system proposed for the ISMIR 2022 submission "Mid-level Harmonic Audio Features for Musical Style Classification" (F. Almeida, G. Bernardes and C. Wei√ü).

## Getting started

First, install the required system dependencies:

- Python 3.8
- Pip package manager
- GNU Make

To install project dependencies, simply run:

```bash
make install
```

## Usage

Interaction with the system is done through the commands defined in the project's `Makefile`, which includes documentation on how to use them. For example, to compute TIV Basic features using the multiple resolution segmentation approach on the Cross-Era Piano dataset, run the following:

```bash
make res_feats dataset=crossera_piano pipeline=tis_basic_segmented
```

A `pipeline` represents the computation of a feature group using a given segmentation approach. Currently available pipelines are:

**Harmonic Segmentation**
- `tis_complexity_segmented`: TIV Complexity
- `tis_basic_segmented`: TIV Basic
- `harm_rhythm`: Harmonic Rhythm

**Multiple Resolutions Segmentation**
- `tis_complexity_res`: TIV Complexity
- `tis_basic_res`: TIV Basic
- `complexity`: Tonal Complexity
- `template_based`: Template-based

**Local Resolution Segmentation**
- `tis_complexity_local_res`: TIV Complexity
- `tis_basic_local_res`: TIV Basic
